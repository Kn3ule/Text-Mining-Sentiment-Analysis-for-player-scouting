He then followed that up with another header at Manchester City to help us to a 2-2 draw at the home of the champions.That was coupled with his excellent defensive duties, keeping clean sheets against Spurs and at Atalanta in our Champions League opener to ensure we ended the month unbeaten.David Raya:Our shot-stopper’s excellent start to the season continued as he followed up his Premier League Save of the Month win by making another incredible stop to save a penalty and the follow up against Atalanta to help us to a valuable point by yet again keeping his sheet clean.That was something he achieved at Spurs as well to take his tally in all competitions up to four by the end of September, while he made a string of good stops at the Etihad Stadium during a second-half barrage to ensure we left we a share of the spoils.William Saliba:The Frenchman continues to be imperious at the back alongside Gabriel, with their partnership perhaps the most effective in the Premier League. That was the case in the north London derby where Willo helped shackle Spurs and keep them from scoring.That was also the case out in Italy when we kept Atalanta at bay, and then William was part of a huge defensive effort that frustrated Manchester City on our way to a famous draw.Bukayo Saka:Last month’s winner carried his form into September by swinging over the two corners that allowed Gabriel to net against Tottenham and City, ensuring he levelled the Premier League record for assisting in each of the first five matches of a campaign, drawing level with Thierry Henry.Bukayo was also handed the captain’s armband for the games against City and Leicester, and played a key role in our late win against the Foxes where his corner led to Wilfred Ndidi’s own goal that saw us edge back in front.", "comments": ["SAKA", "Big Gabi🔥", "Saliba", "@_gabrielmagalhaes 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥", "Raya ❤️🔥", "B.S🙌🔥👏😍", "For me it's Gabriel ❤️", "Captain Saka all the way", "Raya🙌", "Havertz", "Gabriel 👏👏", "Saka without a doubt.", "Gabby", "David raya on top best man for me", "Raya"]}, {"link": "https://www.instagram.com/p/DAnpYHlx_-B/", "caption": "Happy Rosh Hashanah!
